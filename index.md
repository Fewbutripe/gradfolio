Hello! I am a researcher working at [ROMIN](https://romin.re.kr/){:target="_blank"} lab of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology{:target="_blank"}. I work on optimization with artificial intelligence in a variety of interdisciplinary areas, from rotational mechanics to chemistry.

Before KIST, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ewha Womans University{:target="_blank"}, along with a minor in Chemistry & Nanoscience. I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant at HCILab@EWHA{:target="_blank"} and as an intern developer at Blue Solutions{:target="_blank"}, a South Korean startup that develops system software.

[Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to use this space to write your biography here, edit the `index.md` file. You can put a picture in, too. Rename your picture to `profile.png` and put it in the `assets/images/` folder.

The social-icons footer can be used to link profiles from GitHub, OrcID and ReasearchGate aprart form the usual Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can add your user ID in the `_config.yml` file to link your accounts.

PS: If you liked the theme, do star it on GitHub!
